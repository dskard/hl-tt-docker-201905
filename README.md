# Docker, I've been meaning to â€¦

It's something you've been meaning to look into, and every time you're ready to
explore, something else comes up. That's life! Luckily, I have put together
this quick primer presentation for the May 18, 2019 HackLafayette Thunder Talks
that covers where Docker stands in the soup of virtualization setups out there,
which commands you should probably know about to be productive, and an example
of packaging up an application so it can be shared with others.
